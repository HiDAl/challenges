## Code Challenge 01 - Word Values Part I

### Calculate the (language) dictionary word that would have the most value in Scrabble

Read in dictionary.txt (a copy of /usr/share/dict/words on my Mac) and calculate the word that has the most value in Scrabble based on LETTER_SCORES which is imported in wordvalue-template.py. 

Make sure you run the test_wordvalue.py to verify your methods are correct. 

It expects (imports) wordvalue.py so make sure you copy wordvalue-template.py to wordvalue.py

Note that no PyPI modules need to be installed, just use stdlib for this. 

Bonus: something to think about: when calculating the max value can you use a fast builtin method? And even so could you improve the performance even further?

Enjoy!

Please be patient as we are still learning how to best to present the code challenges and collaborate on Github.

We think working towards tests is a good approach. And providing stubs might be a good place to start. But if you have any other ideas or feedback please [let us know](https://github.com/pybites/challenges/issues).
